abstract: This paper documents the cross-country demand trends of Fintech services using their corresponding Google search volumes of high-frequency Fintech-related phrases in recent years. We find that developing countries and those with underdeveloped Fintech industries exhibit higher Fintech demand increases during the pandemic. Moreover, we examine the impact of fintech and other determinants on economic resilience from COVID-19 across the world. We find that stronger Fintech is positively associated with GDP growth and negatively associated with unemployment rates since the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, countries with better education, better economic development prior to COVID-19, lower average population age, or less reliance on the tourism industry achieve stronger recovery in GDP growth. In addition, we develop an economic resilience measure to capture both the speed and strength of economic resistance and recovery in response to the pandemic shock. We find that Fintech development is one of the key determinants of economic resilience.
