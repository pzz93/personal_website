abstract: Utilizing trademark data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we examine the relation between newly registered trademarks and different types of institutional investors. The results show that firms with more diversified institutional ownership are associated with a larger number of new trademark registrations. The positive effect is stronger when the effectiveness of governance from diversified shareholders is higher, when CEOs have less risk-taking incentives, when CEOs are less entrenched, and when firms are exposed to a more competitive environment. We further find that firms with higher non-diversified institutional ownership tend to generate trademarks of lower future quality. They are more likely to renew existing trademarks rather than invest in more innovative activities to develop new products. Besides, we find that firms held by diversified institutional owners are more likely to share common words with their existing trademarks. Taken together, our analysis reveals the important role of diversified institutional ownership in shaping firms’ trademark activities.
