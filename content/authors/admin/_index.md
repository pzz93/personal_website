I am currently completing my Ph.D. at Nanyang Technological University in the Division of Banking and Finance, under the supervision of Prof. [Xin Chang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/changxin/) and Assoc Prof. [Byoung-Hyoun Hwang](https://www.bhwang.com/). I confidently expect to graduate by April 2023. I am especially interested in investigating information embedded in unstructured financial data to find out what affects market participantsâ€™ decisions and behaviors.
